    The SOLID ideas are <br><br>

    1. The Single-responsibility principle: "There should never be more than one reason for a class to change. " In other words, every class should have only one responsibility.<br><br>
    
    2.  The Open–closed principle: "Software entities ... should be open for extension, but closed for modification." <br><br>
    
    3. The Liskov substitution principle: "Functions that use pointers or references to base classes must be able to use objects of derived classes without knowing it." See also design by contract. <br><br>
    
    4. The Interface segregation principle: "Clients should not be forced to depend upon interfaces that they do not use." <br><br>
    
    5. The Dependency inversion principle: "Depend upon abstractions, concretions." <br><br>
