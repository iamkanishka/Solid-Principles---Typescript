    The SOLID ideas are

    The Single-responsibility principle: "There should never be more than one reason for a class to change. " In other words, every class should have only one responsibility.
    
    The Openâ€“closed principle: "Software entities ... should be open for extension, but closed for modification."
    
    The Liskov substitution principle: "Functions that use pointers or references to base classes must be able to use objects of derived classes without knowing it." See also design by contract.
    
    The Interface segregation principle: "Clients should not be forced to depend upon interfaces that they do not use."
    
    The Dependency inversion principle: "Depend upon abstractions, concretions."
